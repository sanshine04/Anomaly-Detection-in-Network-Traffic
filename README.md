# Anomaly-Detection-in-Network-Traffic
This project uses Isolation Forest for anomaly detection in network traffic. It identifies and separates normal traffic from anomalies, visualizing results on an interactive dashboard built with Dash. The dashboard displays a scatter plot, highlighting anomalies in red, and provides a summary of the traffic analysis.
