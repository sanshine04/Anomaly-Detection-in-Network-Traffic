# Anomaly-Detection-in-Network-Traffic
This project uses Isolation Forest for anomaly detection in network traffic. It identifies and separates normal traffic from anomalies, visualizing results on an interactive dashboard built with Dash. The dashboard displays a scatter plot, highlighting anomalies in red, and provides a summary of the traffic analysis.
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in network traffic using the **Isolation Forest** machine learning algorithm. The goal is to identify abnormal traffic patterns that could indicate security threats or unusual activity. The dataset consists of network features, which are preprocessed to handle missing values and scaled to ensure consistent input to the model. The selected features, such as IP addresses and frequency of requests, are used to train the Isolation Forest model, which is well-suited for unsupervised anomaly detection.

The Isolation Forest model works by isolating anomalies from normal data points. It assigns a score to each record based on how easily it can be separated from the rest of the dataset. Records that are isolated quickly (i.e., with fewer splits in the decision trees) are considered anomalies. In this project, we set a contamination level to specify the expected proportion of anomalies in the data. Once the model is trained, it labels each data point as either "Normal" or "Anomalous," providing a binary classification of the network traffic.

To visualize the results, an interactive dashboard is created using Dash and Plotly. The dashboard displays a scatter plot, where normal traffic is represented by blue points and anomalies are highlighted in red. The plot helps users easily distinguish between regular and unusual network activity. Additionally, the dashboard provides a summary of the total number of records, normal traffic, and detected anomalies. This visualization is particularly useful for monitoring and analyzing network behavior in real time.

This project can be expanded to include other machine learning models or customized visualizations depending on the use case. It provides a foundation for anomaly detection in network traffic, offering both a powerful analytical tool and an accessible visual interface for users to monitor network security.
